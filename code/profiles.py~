#Each method in this file takes a physical object and sets a profile for the object. For example, bulletProfile(pObject) will set pObject to have bullet characteristics. Then the bullet will call bulletProfile on itself. This, I think, will clean the code and reduce redundancy and voodoo constants.

		#Give enemy an engine

		engine.setProfile('mk1', ship.engine)
