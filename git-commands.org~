Get my rsa public key
> emacs ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Go to the website
https://github.com/nealholt/asteroids-buff/settings/keys
Go to Deploy Key.
Copy the contents of id_rsa.pub into the box and add new key.

Then back on the command line:
> git config --global user.name "nealholt"
> git config --global user.email neal.holts@gmail.com

> cd Desktop/python/
> git clone git@github.com:nealholt/asteroids-buff.git
> cd asteroids-buff/

Then I copied the contents of backup01/ into asteroids-buff/
Then I ran this next line which "Next, tell Git to take a snapshot of the contents of all files under the current directory (note the .), with git add:" according to http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial
> git add .
> git commit -m "I'm committing the oldest version of the game."
> git push

I then repeated the 3 previous commands while copying each version of the game from the backups folder to the git repo.

> git add . && git commit -m "I'm committing another version of the game from my backups folder."
> git push



To delete a file locally and from the git repo, use:
> git rm file1.txt
