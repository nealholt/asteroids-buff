This is where I experiment with compiling executables of my game for mac and windows.
* TODO get any compiled python program running on mac
Try this first:

Download freeze here:

You can try to run 
python setup.py build
from a moons machine (be sitting in front of it when you run it)
but it looks like you can only compile an executable that will work on the other machines with the same OS. This is based on 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17276543/how-to-use-cx-freeze-in-linux-to-create-a-package-to-be-used-in-windows
"cx_Freeze works on Windows, Mac and Linux, but on each platform it only makes an executable that runs on that platform"

They suggest that pyinstaller be used instead:

* get compiled pygame running on mac
* get multifile compiled running on mac
* get multifile pygame with images running on mac
* get all this running on a pc
py2app is similar in purpose and design to py2exe for Windows.
